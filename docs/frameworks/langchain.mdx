## Overview

Humanlayer integrates seamlessly with [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/) to add human oversight to your AI applications. This guide shows you how to use Humanlayer with LangChain.

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install humanlayer langchain langchain-openai python-dotenv
```

## Basic Example

Let's create a customer onboarding assistant that sends emails with human oversight.

<CodeGroup>

```python main.py
from humanlayer import ContactChannel, SlackContactChannel
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
import langchain_core.tools as langchain_tools
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from humanlayer.core.approval import HumanLayer

load_dotenv()

hl = HumanLayer(
    verbose=True,
    contact_channel=ContactChannel(
        slack=SlackContactChannel(
            channel_or_user_id="",
            experimental_slack_blocks=True,
        )
    ),
    # run_id is optional - it can be used to identify the agent in approval history
    run_id="langchain-customer-email",
)

task_prompt = """
You are the email onboarding assistant. You check on the progress customers
are making and then based on that info, you send friendly and encouraging 
emails to customers to help them fully onboard into the product.

Your task is to send an email to the customer danny@example.com
"""

def get_info_about_customer(customer_email: str) -> str:
    """get info about a customer"""
    return """
    This customer has completed most of the onboarding steps,
    but still needs to invite a few team members before they can be
    considered fully onboarded
    """

# require approval to send an email
@hl.require_approval()
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str:
    """Send an email to a user"""
    return f"Email sent to {to} with subject: {subject}"

tools = [
    langchain_tools.StructuredTool.from_function(get_info_about_customer),
    langchain_tools.StructuredTool.from_function(send_email),
]

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.OPENAI_FUNCTIONS,
    verbose=True,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = agent.run(task_prompt)
    print("\n\n----------Result----------\n\n")
    print(result)
```

```env .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
HUMANLAYER_API_KEY=<your-humanlayer-api-key>
```

</CodeGroup>

## How it Works

1. We create a HumanLayer instance with a Slack contact channel for approvals
2. Define two functions:
   - `get_info_about_customer`: Gets customer onboarding status
   - `send_email`: Sends an email (requires approval)
3. Create LangChain tools from these functions
4. Initialize a LangChain agent with the tools
5. The agent will request approval before sending any emails

## Running the Example

1. Set up your environment variables in `.env`
2. Configure your Slack channel ID in the `contact_channel`
3. Run the example:
```bash
python main.py
```

When the agent attempts to send an email, it will pause and request approval through Slack.

## Next Steps

- Learn more about [require_approval](/core/require-approval)
- Configure [contact channels](/channels/slack)
- Explore [response options](/core/customize-response-options)
- Try the [human-as-tool pattern](/core/human-as-tool)
