## Overview

Humanlayer integrates seamlessly with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI) to add human oversight to your AI applications. This guide shows you how to use Humanlayer with CrewAI.

## Installation

Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install humanlayer crewai crewai-tools python-dotenv
```

## Basic Example

Let's create a simple math agent that performs basic arithmetic operations with human oversight.

<CodeGroup>

```python main.py
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task
from crewai_tools import tool

load_dotenv()

from humanlayer import HumanLayer

hl = HumanLayer(
    # run_id is optional - it can be used to identify the agent in approval history
    run_id="crewai-math",
)

@tool
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b

@tool
@hl.require_approval()
def multiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """multiply two numbers"""
    return a * b

general_agent = Agent(
    role="Math Professor",
    goal="""Provide the solution to the students that are asking
    mathematical questions and give them the answer.""",
    backstory="""You are an excellent math professor that likes to solve math questions
    in a way that everyone can understand your solution""",
    allow_delegation=False,
    tools=[add, multiply],
    verbose=True,
    crew_sharing=False,
)

task = Task(
    description="multiply 2 and 5, then add 32 to the result",
    agent=general_agent,
    expected_output="A numerical answer.",
)

crew = Crew(agents=[general_agent], tasks=[task], verbose=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = crew.kickoff()
    print("\n\n---------- RESULT ----------\n\n")
    print(result)
```

```env .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
HUMANLAYER_API_KEY=<your-humanlayer-api-key>
```

</CodeGroup>

## How it Works

1. We create a HumanLayer instance with an optional `run_id` to identify this agent in the approval history
2. Define two math functions as CrewAI tools using the `@tool` decorator
3. Use `@hl.require_approval()` to require human approval before the `multiply` function can be called
4. Create a CrewAI agent with these tools and a task to perform
5. The agent will request approval before executing the multiply function

## Running the Example

1. Set up your environment variables in `.env`
2. Run the example:
```bash
python main.py
```

When the agent attempts to use the `multiply` function, it will pause and request human approval through your configured contact channel (Slack, Email, etc).
