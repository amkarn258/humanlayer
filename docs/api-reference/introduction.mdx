## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## Base URL

The API is available at:

```
https://api.humanlayer.dev
```

## Response Format

All responses are in JSON format. Error responses include an `error` object with `message` and optional `code` fields.

## Rate Limiting

API requests are limited based on your plan's usage credits. When you exceed your limit, requests will either:

- Be rejected with a 400 status if default-open is disabled
- Auto-approve if default-open is enabled
