- The [Decorator](#decorator) method is the easiest way to add approval requirements to a function
- The [Fetch Approval](#fetch-approval) method is useful if you don't want to use a framework like LangChain or CrewAI, and prefer to roll your own agent execution logic
- The [Creating / Fetching](#creating-and-fetching) method is useful if you also want to control how and when your process checks for results of the approval.
- See [Advanced Usage](#advanced-usage) for concepts like websockets and webhooks

## Structure

Approvals are built on the [Function Call](/api-reference/function-calls) API.

## Methods

There are three main jobs-to-be-done that you can control when using approvals:

- Creating the approval request
- Halting execution until the human approves or rejects the action
- Running the function if approved, or, if rejected, doing something with the rejecter's feedback

In all cases, HumanLayer handles accepting the approval request, and the HumanLayer backend is
responsible for finding the right human and collecting their feedback on the proposed action.

### Decorator

You can use the `require_approval` decorator to halt execution until the human approves or rejects the action.

```python
@require_approval
def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str) -> str:
    """
    Send an email to the customer
    """
    ...
```

In this case, the HumanLayer SDK handles:

- Creating the approval request
- Halting execution until the human approves or rejects the action
- Running the function if approved, or returning feedback to the LLM if rejected

#### Example

See [01_math_example.py](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/tree/main/examples/openai_client/01_math_example.py) for a full example.

### Fetching an Approval

You can use the `fetch_approval` method to halt execution until the human approves or rejects the action,
and receive a result that you can use to decide what to do next.

<Note type="tip">
  Fetch Approval is useful if you don't want to use a framework like LangChain
  or CrewAI, and prefer to roll your own agent execution logic.
</Note>

```python
approval = fetch_approval(
    FunctionCallSpec(
        fn="send_email",
        kwargs={
            "to": "customer@example.com",
            "subject": "Welcome!",
            "body": "Thanks for signing up!"
        }
    ),
)

completed = approval.as_completed()

if completed.approved:
    print("Email sent!")
else:
    print(f"Email not sent, comment was {completed.comment}")
```

In this case, the HumanLayer SDK handles:

- Creating the approval request
- Halting execution until the human approves or rejects the action

And your code is reponsible for:

- Running the function if approved, or doing something with the feedback if rejected

Usually you will be passing it back to an LLM but you could also hand it to a human who take over the task, log it, or anything else.

#### Example

See [02_imperative_fetch.py](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/tree/main/examples/openai_client/02_imperative_fetch.py) for a full example.

### Creating and Fetching

For the (perhaps extra-based) who want maximum control over execution flow, you can create and fetch approvals separately.
This is useful if you want to implement your own waiting logic or integrate with a custom event loop.

```python
from humanlayer import FuntionCallSpec
```

```python
# Example of low-level approval flow
elif function_name == "multiply":
    call = hl.create_function_call(
        spec=FunctionCallSpec(
            fn="multiply",
            kwargs=function_args,
        ),
        # call_id is optional but you can supply it if you want,
        # in this case the openai tool_call_id is a natural choice
        call_id=tool_call.id,
    )
    # loop until the call is approved
    while (not call.status) or (call.status.approved is None):
        time.sleep(5)
        call = hl.get_function_call(call_id=tool_call.id)
    if call.status.approved:
        function_result = multiply(**function_args)
        function_response_json = json.dumps(function_result)
    else:
        function_response_json = json.dumps(
            {"error": f"call {call.spec.fn} not approved, comment was {call.status.comment}"}
        )
```

You can also create and fetch approvals separately, which is useful if you want to implement your own waiting logic:

In this case, the HumanLayer SDK handles:

- Creating the approval request
- Fetching the approval status

And your code is reponsible for:

- Halting execution until the human approves or rejects the action (usually waiting in some sort of loop)
- Running the function if approved, or doing something with the feedback if rejected

#### Example

See [03_imperative_fetch_based.py](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/tree/main/examples/openai_client/03_imperative_fetch_based.py) for a full example.

## Advanced Usage

### Websockets and Asyncio

As of version 0.6.1, there is work in progress to add websocket support to the HumanLayer SDK, which will also include an asyncio-ready client implementation.

### Webhooks

Webhooks let you do something like in [create and fetch](#creating-and-fetching), but receive a webhook instead of polling.

If you are interested in webhooks, please reach out to us at contact@humanlayer.dev and we can add you to the beta.
