Response Webhooks are a way to receive notifications when an approval is requested or completed.

This is an advanced feature that requires a bit of setup on your end. If you're interested in getting started quickly, we
recommend using one of the following methods instead:

- [Approval Decorator](/core/require-approval#decorator)
- [fetch approval](/core/require-approval#fetching-an-approval)
- [fetch response](/core/human-as-tool#fetch-response)

<Note>
  Response Webhooks are currently in beta. If you'd like to help us test and
  improve the feature, please reach out to us at contact@humanlayer.dev

## Overview

Using response webhooks generally involves a few steps:

1. [Choose a way you'll uniquely identify the operation](#1-choose-an-operation-identifier)
2. [Create an operation](#2-create-the-operation)
3. [Store your agent's workflow state](#3-store-operation-state)
4. [Create a webhook endpoint](#4-create-webhook-endpoint)
5. [Configure webhook in HumanLayer](#5-configure-webhook-in-dashboard)
6. [Handle webhook responses](#6-handle-webhook-response)

You can find a complete working example in our [FastAPI Webhooks Example](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/tree/main/examples/fastapi-webhooks).

### 1. Choose an Operation Identifier

First, decide how you'll uniquely identify each operation in your system. You have several options:

- Use a server-generated [call_id](/core/run-ids-and-call-ids)
- Use an external identifier (like OpenAI's `tool_call_id`)
- Create your own custom identifier system

### 2. Create the Operation

Use the appropriate creation endpoint based on your needs:

```python
# Create a pending approval
pending_approval = await hl.create_function_call(
    spec=FunctionCallSpec(
        fn="purchase_materials",
        kwargs={"material": "wood", "quantity": 10},
    )
)

# Store the call_id for later use
call_id = pending_approval.call_id
```

### 3. Store Operation State

Store your agent's workflow state so you can resume it when the webhook arrives. Common approaches include:

#### Dictionary Storage (Simple)

```python
# In-memory storage (for demonstration)
operations = {}
operations[call_id] = pending_approval
```

#### Database Storage (Production)

```python
# Using your preferred database
await db.operations.insert({
    "call_id": call_id,
    "status": "pending",
    "spec": pending_approval.spec.model_dump(),
    "created_at": datetime.now()
})
```

### 4. Create Webhook Endpoint

Create an endpoint in your application to receive webhook notifications:

```python
@app.post("/webhook/inbound")
async def webhook_inbound(webhook: FunctionCall) -> Dict[str, str]:
    # Retrieve the operation using call_id
    call_id = webhook.call_id

    # Update operation status
    operations[call_id] = webhook

    # Handle approval/rejection
    if webhook.status is not None and webhook.status.approved:
        # Execute the approved operation
        await execute_operation(webhook.spec.fn, webhook.spec.kwargs)
    else:
        print(f"Operation {call_id} denied")
        # or append the rejection to an LLM context window and let it try again

    return {"status": "ok"}
```

### 5. Configure Webhook in Dashboard

In the [HumanLayer Dashboard](https://app.humanlayer.dev):

1. Navigate to `Response Webhooks`
2. Create a new endpoint with your URL
3. Subscribe to relevant events:
   - `function_call.completed`
   - `human_contact.completed`

### 6. Handle Webhook Response

When your endpoint receives a webhook:

1. Validate the webhook payload
2. Update your stored operation state
3. Execute any approved operations
4. Return a success response

## Complete Example

For a complete working example including ngrok setup for local development, see our [FastAPI Webhooks Example](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/tree/main/examples/fastapi-webhooks).

The example demonstrates:

- Setting up a FastAPI application with webhook handling
- Managing operation state
- Processing approvals and rejections
- Local development with ngrok
