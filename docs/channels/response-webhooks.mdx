Response Webhooks are a way to receive notifications when an approval is requested or completed.

This is an advanced feature that requires a bit of setup on your end. If you're interested in getting started quickly, we
reccomend using one of the following methods instead:

- [Approval Decorator](/core/require-approval#decorator)
- [fetch approval](/core/require-approval#fetching-an-approval)
- [fetch response](/core/human-as-tool#fetch-response)

<Note>
  Response Webhooks are currently in alpha. If you'd like to help us test and
  improve the feature, please reach out to us at contact@humanlayer.dev

## Overview

Using response webhooks generally involves a few steps. We'll use the term "operation" to refer to the agent request being approved / responded to.

1. [Choose a way you'll uniquely identify the operation](#1-choose-an-operation-identifier)
2. [Create an operation ](#2-create-the-operation) for [approval](/core/human-as-tool#creating-and-fetching) or [human contact](/core/human-as-tool#creating-and-fetching)
   - if you are using an external identifier, set it as the `call_id` during creation

- [Store your agent's workflow state / running context window](#3-store-operation-state) somewhere, in a way that you can look it up by the operation's identifier
- Create a webhook endpoint on your server that will receive notifications from HumanLayer
- Add your webhook endpoint as a callback URL in the HumanLayer dashboard, subscribing to the approval_completed or human_contact_completed events
- When a valid webhook is received, look up the operation's state using the identifier you chose, append the human's response to the context window, and continue the agent's workflow

### 1. Choose an Operation Identifier

First, decide how you'll uniquely identify each operation in your system. You have several options:

- Use a server-generated [call_id](/core/run-ids-and-call-ids)
- Use an external identifier (like OpenAI's `tool_call_id`)
- Create your own custom identifier system

### 2. Create the Operation

Use the appropriate creation endpoint based on your needs:

- For approvals: Use the [approval creation endpoint](/core/human-as-tool#creating-and-fetching)
- For human contact: Use the [human contact creation endpoint](/core/human-as-tool#creating-and-fetching)

If you're using an external identifier, make sure to set it as the `call_id` parameter during creation.

After creating the operation, you'll want to pause your workflow somehow. For example, in LangGraph you can use the [NodeInterrupt exception](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/dynamic_breakpoints/) to halt execution.

### 3. Store Operation State

Implement a storage solution for your agent's workflow state and context so you can resume it when the webhook response arrives. The way you do this will be framework-specific, but a few examples include

- [Database Storage](#database-storage)
- [Orchestrator State](#orchestrator-state)

#### Database Storage

Store your context in a SQL database with fields like:

- Operation ID
- Agent state
- Message history
- Timestamp

#### State Management

Use a state management solution like LangGraph to maintain your agent's context. In this case you'll want to use a LangGraph identifier as your call ID.

### 4. Create Webhook Endpoint

Set up an endpoint on your server that will:

- Receive POST requests from HumanLayer
- Validate webhook signatures
- Process the incoming webhook data

Webhooks will be sent with the fully completed [FunctionCall](/api-reference/function-calls) or [HumanContact](/api-reference/human-contacts) object,
which will include the `call_id` you set during creation, as well as the resolved response in `status`.

### 5. Configure Webhook in Dashboard

In the HumanLayer dashboard:

- Navigate to the webhooks section
- Add your endpoint URL
- Subscribe to relevant events:
  - `approval_completed`
  - `human_contact_completed`

### 6. Handle Webhook Response

When your endpoint receives a webhook:

- Look up the operation using your chosen identifier
- Retrieve the stored agent state/context
- Append the human's response to the context
- Resume your agent's workflow with the updated information
