## Configuration

The Email contact channel allows agents to send emails and collect responses through email threads.
Configure an email channel using the `EmailContactChannel` model:

```python
from humanlayer import ContactChannel, EmailContactChannel

email_with_compliance = ContactChannel(
    email=EmailContactChannel(
        address="compliance@example.com",
        context_about_user="an email with the compliance team",
        experimental_subject_line="Re: Compliance Review",  # Optional - custom subject line
    )
)
```

  />
</Frame>

### Email Address

The `address` field must be a valid email address that will receive the messages.

### Context

The optional `context_about_user` field helps the LLM understand who it's emailing:

```python
# Good context examples
"an email with the compliance team"
"an email with the user you are helping"
"an email with the head of marketing"
```

## Usage

Use the email channel with either `require_approval` or `human_as_tool` features:

```python
# With require_approval
@hl.require_approval(contact_channel=email_with_compliance)
def create_linear_ticket(title: str, assignee: str, description: str, project: str, due_date: str) -> str:
    """create a ticket in linear"""
    ...

import langchain_tools

# With human_as_tool in langchain
tools = [
    langchain_tools.StructuredTool.from_function(
        hl.human_as_tool(
            contact_channel=email_with_compliance,
        )
    ),
]
```

Or you can pass the `contact_channel` to the `HumanLayer` instance:

```python
hl = HumanLayer(contact_channel=email_with_compliance)
```

If you pass a channel to the `HumanLayer` instance, you don't need to pass it to the `require_approval` or `human_as_tool` features.
If you pass it to both, the channel in the `require_approval` or `human_as_tool` will take precedence.

## Advanced - Collecting Agent Emails in a single thread

By default, every human contact or function call with trigger a new standalone email thread.

However, if you're building agents that are kicked off by email runs,
you likely want the email responses to be collected in a single thread.

You can do this by using the `experimental_in_reply_to_message_id` and `experimental_references_message_id` parameters
to the EmailContactChannel, using the inbound emails `Message-ID` header as the value.

Below is an example where the inbound email is sent by the same human who will be responding to approval/human_as_tool requests.

```python

def handle_inbound_email(raw_email_content: str, headers: dict) -> str:
    message_id = headers["Message-ID"]

    email_with_threading = ContactChannel(
        email=EmailContactChannel(
            address=headers["From"], # send agent messages to whomever initiated the email thread
            context_about_user="an email thread with the user you're assisting",
            experimental_in_reply_to_message_id=message_id, # reply to the inbound email
            experimental_references_message_id=message_id, # reference the inbound email
        )
    )

    hl = HumanLayer(contact_channel=email_with_threading)

    run_agent_in_response_to_email(
        base_prompt="You are a helpful compliance assistant, please handle this email",
        raw_email_content=raw_email_content,
        tools=[
            some_readonly_tool,
            hl.require_approval(some_risky_tool),
            hl.human_as_tool(),

        ]
    )

```

These features are marked as experimental because we're still working on documenting how different email providers handle threading
why one or both of these headers are used.
